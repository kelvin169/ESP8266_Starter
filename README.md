first project 
in this project, I'm using the ESP8266 module to control a power strip over the WiFi connection. 
I'm using TRIAC with the MOC opto driver to control up to 12A. 

The idea is to control the power strip using my smart phone over the internet. 

The software on the module will be the nodeMCU with LUA scripts.
